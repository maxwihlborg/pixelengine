A simple game framework useful for prototyping. Not really that usefull in it’s current stage. Big work in progress.

If you wanna use it anyway though, just add the base files to your project, as a suggestion inside an js folder, and you should be good to go if you have some experience with [require.js](http://requirejs.org/).

Some features:

- Preloading using a batch fetch algorithm.
- Texture unpacking of [TexturePacker](http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) json format.
- [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) drawing and soon to be added collision checks.
- Simple Entity Component System that probably will be removed or reworked.

Mainly made for my participation in the [29’th Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) 48 hour challenge. Starting on 25th of April 2014.
