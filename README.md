A simple game framework useful for prototyping. Not really meant to be used in it’s current stage. Big work in progress.

If you wanna use anyway though add the base files to your project as a suggestion inside an js folder, and you should be good to go if you have some experience with [require.js](http://requirejs.org/).

Some features:

- Preloading using a batch fetch algorithm.
- Texture unpacking of [TexturePacker](http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker) json format.
- [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) drawing and soon to be added collision checks.
- Simple Entity Component System that probably will be removed quite soon.

Manly made for participation in the [29’th Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/) challenge. Starting on 25th of April 2014.
